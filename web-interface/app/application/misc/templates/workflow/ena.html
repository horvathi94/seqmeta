<h1>Uploading to ENA</h1>

<p>
Download the `.zip` file as described in the guide. This zip file contains the 
following files:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>samples.tsv</strong>, this file contains the metadata of the samples.
	</li>
	{#
	<li>
		<strong>experiments.tsv</strong>, this file contains the metadata of the 
		sequencing library.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>manifest.txt</strong>, this file contains the metadata of the assembled
		sequences.
	</li>
	#}
	<li>
		<strong>reads directory</strong>, this direcotry contains the sequencing reads
		of the samples.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>assemblies/contigs directory</strong>, this directory contains the contigs assemblies 
		and the manifest files of these.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>assemblies/scaffolds directory</strong>, this directory contains the scaffolds assemblies 
		and the manifest files of these.
	</li>
</ul>


<p>Submitting files to ENA:</p>
<p>(It is assumed that you have already have a Webin account.)</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Register a study (project)</strong> trough the web interface in the <em>New Submissions</em> tab. Skip this step if you have already registered the study with which you would like to associate the samples.</li>

	<li><strong>Register the samples</strong> trough the web interface in the <em> New Submissions</em> tab by uploading the <strong>samples.tsv</strong> file. Check for errors and correct them. The validation of the samples is
	done against the ERC000033 checklist.</li>
	
	<li>Use any <em>webin-cli</em> program to submit the reads and assemblies. We recommend the use of the <a href="https://github.com/enasequence/webin-cli">docker image</a> 
	as this is much easier to install and manage.</li>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Navigate to the <em>reads directory</em> and <strong>modify the manifest files</strong>, by copying the studies accession number in the place of the "<em>&ltcopy study name here!&gt</em>"</li>
		<li><strong>Submit all read files</strong> trough the webin-cli using the manifest files. (For docker version you can find more details at the end).</li>
		<li>Navigate to the <strong>assemblies/contigs directory</strong> and modify the manifest files, by copying the accession number of the study you wish to associate to the assembly
		in the place of the "<em>&ltcopy study name here!&gt</em>", also replace the "<em>&ltRUN_REF&gt</em>" with the run accession numbers of the samples. The <em>RUN_REF</em> field
		is not mandatory so you can even skip this by deleting this row, but this is not recommended.</li>
		<li><strong>Submit the contigs files</strong>with the webin-cli.</li>
		<li>Repeat the last two steps for the <strong>scaffolds files</strong>, located in the <em>assemblies/scaffolds</em> directory.</li>
	</ol>


<h3>Uploading the sequencing files</h3>

<p>
To perform this task you can use FTP clients or Webin-CLI from the command line <a href="https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/general-guide.html">a general guide on data submission</a>). The ENA documentation on uploading SARS-CoV-2 data recommands the use of the Webin-CLI.
Here we present the use of containerized version of the Webin-CLI this is much easier to manage than the Java client if you have Docker installed just be sure to keep your Docker image updated.
</p>


<p>
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Install docker</a> if you haven't already.
	Use the following command to get the docker image for the webin-cli: 
</p>
<code>
	docker pull enasequence/webin-cli
</code>

<p>A basic command model for uploading on Linux system:</p>
<code>docker run --rm --name=ena-upload -v $(pwd):/data enasequence/webin-cli [options]</code>


<p>A basic command model for uploading on Windows system:</p>
<code>docker run --rm --name=ena-upload -v &lthost-machine-directory&gt:/data enasequence/webin-cli [options]</code>



<p><strong>Docker command:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The <code>docker run</code> command starts the docker container.</li>
	<li>The <code>--rm</code> option tells docker to remove the container after finishing its job.</li>
	<li>The <code>--name</code> option names the container. This is optional, but it helps keep track of the containers you are running on your machine.</li>
	<li>The <code>-v</code> option mounts volumes into the container, which basicly means that the container and the host machine will share anything stored in the mounted directory.
	The first part defines the absolute path to the directory on the host machine (here marked by <code>$(pwd)</code>, which is a Linux command, which returns the aboslute path of the 
	current directory, on other machines you may need to manually type this in or find another command). The second part, after the <em>:</em> marks where this directory will be mounted inside the container, do not modify this part, as the image of the container is configured to run with files inside the <em>/data</em> directory.</li>
	<li>The <code>enasequence/webin-cli</code> is the name of the docker image from which the container will be created. Do not modify this.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Basic options for Webin-CLI:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><code>-userName</code> the Webin submission account name.</li>
	<li><code>-password</code> the Webin submission acccount password.</li>
	<li><code>-manifest</code> the manifest file name.</li>
	<li><code>-inputDir</code> input directory for files delcared in the manifest file. If you are using the Docker version, you need to specify the directory inside the container to where you mounted the files (this would be <em>/data</em> directory if you have not made any changes to the command for running docker).</li>
	<li><code>-validate</code> validates the files defined in the manifest file.</li>
	<li><code>-submit</code> validates and submits the files defined in the manifest file.</li>
	<li><code>-test</code> use Webin test service instead of the production service. Please note that the Webin upload area is shared between test and production services, and that test submission files will not be archived.</li>
</ul>

<p>For a more detailed list of all available Webin-CLI options check out the <a href="https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/general-guide/webin-cli.html">documentation</a>. Or use the <code>-help</code> option to display a help screen.</p>
